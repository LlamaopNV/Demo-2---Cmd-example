<h1>Demo 2 - Cmd Example</h1>

<p><strong>Application Intro:</strong> Demo 2 - Cmd Example is a demonstration of my skillset in C++, the second in a series I am working on. It's designed as a command line application that showcases various functionalities, highlighting my ability to integrate and interact with Windows system functions and file structures.</p>

<h2>Application Use</h2>
<p>This command line application offers the user five distinct options, each demonstrating a specific capability:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Ping Command:</strong> A simple function that demonstrates the use of Windows system functions. It includes input validation to determine if the user has provided a URL or an IP address. The application will then perform a ping to the provided target.</li>
    <li><strong>Windows File Directory Function:</strong> This function prompts the user for a file directory. It validates the provided directory and analyzes its contents, including counting files and folders, calculating total file size, and identifying the largest and smallest files along with their sizes in bytes. It also reports the last modified file, the least common file type, and the most common file type within the directory.</li>
    <li><strong>Text File Explorer:</strong> (Under Development) This function will allow users to specify the directory of a .txt file. The application will then analyze the contents of the file, showcasing my ability to read and interpret text data.</li>
    <li><strong>Json File Explorer:</strong> (Under Development) In this function, users will be able to input a .Json file. The application will read and summarize the Json file, including the number of data fields it contains. This is particularly relevant for demonstrating my skills with APIs and Json file handling.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Project Status</h2>
<p>Please note that the Text File Explorer and Json File Explorer functions are currently in development and are not available in the current build of the application.</p>

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>This application is a demo and is intended to showcase my capabilities in software development using C++ and Windows system functions. It is not intended for commercial use.</p>
