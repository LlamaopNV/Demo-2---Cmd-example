<h1>Demo 2 - Cmd Example</h1>

<p><strong>Application Intro:</strong> Demo 2 - Cmd Example is a demonstration of my skillset in C++, the second in a series I am working on. It's designed as a command line application that showcases various functionalities, highlighting my ability to integrate and interact with Windows system functions and file structures.</p>

<h2>Application Features</h2>
<p>This command line application offers the user three core features:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Ping Command:</strong> A simple function that demonstrates the use of Windows system functions. It includes input validation to determine if the user has provided a URL or an IP address. The application will then perform a ping to the provided target.</li>
    <li><strong>Directory Summary:</strong> This function prompts the user for a file directory. It validates the provided directory and analyzes its contents, including counting files and folders, calculating total file size, and identifying the largest and smallest files along with their sizes in bytes. It also reports the last modified file, the least common file type, and the most common file type within the directory.</li>
    <li><strong>Text File Explorer:</strong> This function demonstrates interaction with external data sources while handling them within memory. The application scans the user's active directory for all text files, lists them, and allows the user to select a text file for further interaction. Available commands include searching for a word, replacing words, reading the file in reverse, word frequency analysis, listing longest and shortest words, average word length, total number of unique words, and most and least frequent starting and ending letters.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Developer Notes</h2>
<p>The current build of the application is an unpublished build and requires VS 2022 to run as it is dependent on C++ V17 or later.</p>

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>This application is a demo and is intended to showcase my capabilities in software development using C++ and Windows system functions. It is not intended for commercial use.</p>
